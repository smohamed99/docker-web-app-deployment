Docker Web App Deployment

This project shows how I built and deployed a simple web application using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

What I Conducted
- Created a custom Dockerfile to package my web app
- Built a Docker image and ran it locally
- Deployed the image to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Troubleshooted port conflicts and learned how containers work

What I Learned
Working on this project gave me a better understanding of:
- How Docker images and containers function
- How Elastic Beanstalk automates deployments
- The importance of containerisation for consistent app performance

 Files
- `Dockerfile` – instructions to build the custom Docker image  
- `index.html` – basic web page for testing deployment  
- `docs/project-report.pdf` – detailed summary of my work and results
